<h1>CSS Introduction!</h1>
<h2>What is CSS?
</h2>
<p>very web page and web document has a unique presentation style using specific fonts, colors, spacing, background, etc. It is a “style-sheet” language that contains all the information necessary to describe  how all the elements of the web page are combined together to give an attractive and interesting look and feel.
</p>
<p>Web Browsers read and apply all the CSS rules to a web page/web document to affect how they are displayed to the user. These rules are are formed from :
</p>
<p>Sets of properties (ex. Font type/font family/font color)
Selectors (ex. The paragraphs to which the properties will be applied)
</p>
<h3>Styling text, color and images with CSS
</h3>
<p>Text starts at the top left of the page and flows toward the end of it and the styling is divided into 2 categories.
</p>
<p>Font Styling (choosing the font type/font size/etc)
Layout Styling (spacing between letters/lines, text alignment,etc)
</p>
<p>Color sets the properties of the foreground/backgroung content as well as the text decorations
</p>
<p>Images can be stylized by defining their properties for page alignment, shape, size, opacity and borders.
</p>
<h4>Box Model
</h4>
<p>In CSS the Box model is used for determining the general design and layout of every element in the HTML page. It allows us to add a border around the elements, to define space between elements and is consisted of four different parts
</p>
<p>Content (this is where the text and images appear)
Padding (the area around the content which is transparent
Border (it goes around the padding and the content)
Margin (it clears the area around the border and is transparent)
</p>
<h5>Positioning
</h5>
<p>The positioning property is used to specify how each element is positioned inside a web page/web document and there are 5 different methods
</p>
<p>Static
Relative
Absolute
Fixed
Sticky
</p>
<h6>FlexBox
</h6>
<p>The Flexible Box Module is a one dimentional layout model used to distribute and align the space between elements and is divided in 2 axes.
</p>
<p>The main axis has 4 possible values (row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse)
The cross axis has 2 possible values (row/row-reverse)
</p>
